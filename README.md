# Time-Based-Profit-Distribution Dashboard
Project Overview:

This Power BI project analyzes sales and profit distribution over time, focusing on how different segments and products contribute to overall performance.
It helps visualize key business metrics, identify top performers, and uncover profitability patterns across quarters and regions.

Objectives:

* Analyze profit and sales performance by year, quarter, and country.
* Identify top-performing products and customer segments.
* Explore the relationship between sales volume and profitability.
* Deliver a dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making.

* Total Units Sold: 48.23K, exceeding the goal of 45K by +7.18%.
* Gross Sales: 5.64M, indicating strong sales growth within the selected period.
* Gross Profit: Achieved a profitability score of 63.78%, reflecting healthy margins.
* Top Performing Products:
* Paseo leads with 1.80M in revenue.
